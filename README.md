This service creates HTTP server to execute a shell script placed near to it.
No need to install any dependencies (except NodeJS itself), just run it.

Use the following command to start the server:
```shell
node run_sh_server.js
```

Run the script via HTTP:
```shell
curl http://localhost:3000
```
